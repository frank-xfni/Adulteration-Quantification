**"Feature Selection-Driven Machine Learning for Parallel Species Authentication and Adulteration Quantification in Commercial Dairy Products via Raman Fingerprints"** by Yaju Zhao, Xiaofeng Ni, Minmin Tang.

##  Overview

This project implements a novel parallel machine learning framework for dairy product analysis. It simultaneously addresses two critical tasks: species authentication (classification) and adulteration quantification (regression) using Raman spectroscopy.
